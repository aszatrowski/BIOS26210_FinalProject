# BIOS 26210 Final Project
Prof. Dmitry Kondrashov

*By Theresa Christiansen, Miguel Saucedo, and Austin Szatrowski*


* Recreate Model 3 to show the fractal structure (solve numericaly), plot $x(i+1)$ vs $x(i)$

## Figure 1
* One bifurcation is now visible (the 1:1 to 2:2 transition) but nothing else is; not sure why
* Something with the $n$ parameter? still not sure what that does -Austin
## Figure 2
* Make the memory function (lab 7) to plot $y(i)$ vs $x(i)$ creating cobweb plots
* use $t_s = 400, 276, 264, 50$ ms
