## Space for Project Notes
* This can be a space for collaborative notes, task tracking, etc.
* Make the no memory function
* Replicate Fig 1. ts = np.linspace(0,400,4000)  "no memory"
* Make the memory function (lab 7) to plot y(i) vs x(i) creating cobweb plots
* use ts = 400ms, 276ms, 264ms, 50ms
* Recreate Model 3 to show the fractal structure (solve numericaly), plot x(i+1) vs x(i)
*
